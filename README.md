# World of tanks NL/BE clans    
The new wot nl/be clans site as update for [wotnlclans.mkopenga.com](https://wotnlclans.mkopenga.com)  
On this site you can view the all the NL/BE clans  

## Why?  
- Because I want to learn vue.js and spf.js.  
- Because the old site uses 3 npm scripts (that can break) and 2 domains and 1 domain for making the website.  
- The curent site is slow on a normal mobiel connection it takes 25s  

## How to install:  
- Clone the project  
- Install nodejs  
- Inside the cloned folder open a terminal and type: npm i   
- After that's dune type: npm start  

## Site Goal
- In 5s have a site where the top 100 clans are visable  
- Use dynamic url's for better sharing things  
- Not use jquery
